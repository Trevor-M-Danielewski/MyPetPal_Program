# My Pet Pal Program

## Description:

This was a program that I developed, alongside two other members, that was for our final project in our Information Systems class in the spring semester of 2023.

My Pet Pal is a program designed to assist pet owners and veterinarians in calculating the required calories and feeding schedules for dogs and cats. By providing information such as the pet's status (spayed/neutered), weight, and activity level (for dogs only), the program calculates the optimal caloric intake and generates a feeding schedule tailored to the specific needs of the pet. This program aims to promote the health and well-being of pets by ensuring they receive appropriate nutrition based on their individual characteristics.

## Validation and Testing

My Pet Pal has undergone rigorous validation and testing to ensure the accuracy of its calculations. During the development process, we conducted extensive testing using a variety of scenarios, covering different pet profiles, weight ranges, and activity levels. The program consistently produced results that align with established veterinary guidelines and recommendations.

We also consulted with experts in pet nutrition and reviewed scientific reports to validate our calculations for Resting Energy Requirement (RER) and Maintenance Energy Requirement (MER). The accuracy of our program is a result of the meticulous attention to detail and the commitment to providing reliable nutrition recommendations for pets.

I even use this program personally to help me feed my cat Marcus :D
